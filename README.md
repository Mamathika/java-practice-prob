# Java DSA & Pattern Problems ðŸš€

This repository contains my practice solutions for **Java coding problems**, covering:
- Arrays
- 2D Arrays (Matrix problems)
- Recursion
- Number problems (prime, palindrome, Armstrong, perfect numbers, etc.)
- Pattern printing (stars, triangles, diamonds, etc.)

These programs are useful for placements and for strengthening core problem-solving in Java.
